# TaskManager
This is an unsophisticated project that I've made for the purposes of evaluating and consolidating my knowledge of Spring.

### Introduction
This is a simple web aplication, that behaves like a task managment system and gives the user a small variety of options: to create a new Task, finish an existing task or remove it.
Each task has a due date. If a task is not finished by the due date, it gets the expired status.
Administrator privileges allow the user to  edit other user's data. 

It integrated the following frameworks and third-party projects:

+ Spring Boot
+ Spring MVC
+ Spring Security
+ Spring Data JPA
+ Hibernate
+ Maven
+ Mysql
+ Thymeleaf
+ Bootstrap
+ FlyWay
